# Peer Review of the Societal Relevance of Humanities Research

This is the analysis code for the research project on societal relevance of humanities research. 

## Inferential statistics: main models

Notebook with the bayesian models used in the paper to analyze the data.

## Sanity checks

Notebooks with some basic checks to make sure that the outcomes of the thurstonian models make sense.

## Effect sizes (to be added)

Notebook with the various tests we use to answer the main questions of this project. Is called 'effect sizes' because this is what we use for most of them.

## Preregistered analysis

Contains the simulations and analysis that we preregistered. There were some errors, and we made some improvements after seeing the data. This will be communicated clearly, and the research will be presented as exploratory. The preregistered code is still available here, and shows that the test methods and overall model design remained the same. 

## IIH_CheckRaters

Used to check whether the ratings of the raters met the consistency and time requirements before they got to move on to the next set of 10 sets. If raters failed to meet these, we asked them to redo the set.

## IIH_abstractCoding

Notebook to manage the coding of the content of abstracts.
